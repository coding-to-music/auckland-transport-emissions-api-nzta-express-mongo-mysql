## Background and Purpose

A successful trial was undertaken GWRC to calculate the present and historical emissions of the public transport bus fleet across the Wellington region in 2019. As a result of this trial, NZTA Waka Kotahi has requested a proof-of-concept study to examine whether this model can be applied to the Auckland region. This work was undertaken in collaboration with Victoria University of Wellington and supervised by Chris Vallyon. 

The study will examine the emissions generated by two bus operators, Go Bus and Ritchies. Collectively, they service **Number**% of the trips across the Auckland bus network. Auckland Transport manages the public transport network across Auckland. They will provide the operational data that will be processed into the inputs for the emissions model.

- Outline the Stakeholders involved in this work (i.e. NZTA & AT)
- Outline the motivation and benefit for public bus emissions to be estimated using a software-driven approach
- Declare the intent to use the model already developed by generating the required inputs from provided data
- Outline the broad limitations of the approach (i.e. categories of assumptions)

## Overview of Methodology

- Describe the retrieval of data from the developer's portal (i.e. the various APIs and the data that they provide)
- Describe how the data sources are joined to generate the inputs for the model
- Outline the process of the model produced in the previous study 

## Assumptions and Interpolations

**Important section**

- Outline the assumptions made when forming the model inputs from the data
- Outline the assumptions inherent the model already (e.g. emissions calculated at the trip level based on average speed)
- Outline the assumptions around passenger loading and the impacts of it on the model
- Present results of comparison to real fuel consumption data (if we receive the data)

## Outputs and Visualisations of the Analysis Tool

- Brief description of outputs of the model
