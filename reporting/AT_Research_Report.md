## Background and Purpose

- Outline the Stakeholders involved in this work (i.e. NZTA & AT)
- Outline the motivation and benefit for public bus emissions to be estimated using a software-driven approach
- Declare the intent to use the model already developed by generating the required inputs from provided data
- Outline the broad limitations of the approach (i.e. categories of assumptions)

**Draft**

There is currently a national drive to reduce emissions as a measure of mitigating human-induced climate change. Within the transport sector, public transport is an important method of reducing the emissions of the transport network as a whole. The majority of buses on New Zealand public transport networks are diesel. Therefore, improving national and regional understanding of the emissions of buses on the public transport network can assist with planning and decision-making at a high level to meet emission reduction goals.

The most accurate methodology to estimate emission quantities is to examine fuel consumption of the buses on a public transport network. However, this approach has several limitations. These include: 

- Buses on the network are typically used for other purposes (e.g. private charters, rail replacements, special services). The emissions generated by these activities are not attributable to public bus network.
- Fuel consumption data can be commercially sensitive under certain contractual frameworks.
- This data is not typically collected centrally by the public organisation operating the entire network.

As a result, a software-based approach using network operation data in conjunction with formulae from the European Union EMEP/EEA air pollutant emission inventory guidebook may be more suitable. This approach is likely to be easier to implement and roll out at a large scale while maintaining acceptable levels of accuracy. 

A successful trial was undertaken by GWRC and VUW in 2019 to use a software-based approach to calculate the present and historical emissions of the public transport bus fleet across the Wellington region. As a result of this trial, NZTA Waka Kotahi has requested a proof-of-concept study to examine whether this model can be applied to the Auckland region. This work was undertaken in collaboration with Victoria University of Wellington and supervised by Chris Vallyon.

This pilot study will examine the emissions generated by two bus operators on the Auckland network, Go Bus and Ritchies. Collectively, they service **Number**% of the trips across the Auckland bus network. Auckland Transport manages the public transport network across Auckland. They will provide the operational data that will be processed into the inputs for the emissions model. The emissions model then uses these inputs to generate an estimate of the emissions generated by each bus on a given trip. The output from the model can then be aggregated upwards to provide an estimate for the emissions generated by a given vehicle, a given route, or over the entire network.

This report will outline the methodology used to produce this model. In the instance where provided data may be incomplete or limited, we will outline any assumptions and interpolations required in order to generate a complete model. 



## Overview of Methodology

- Describe the retrieval of data from the developer's portal (i.e. the various APIs and the data that they provide)
- Describe how the data sources are joined to generate the inputs for the model
- Outline the process of the model produced in the previous study 

The methodology used to apply the model to the Auckland context can be separated into the following two broad steps:

1. Procurement, joining, and filtering of raw operational data into the form used by the Emissions model.
2. Using the previously developed Emissions model to estimate and visualise large scale emissions based on the processed operational data.

### Data Sources

The primary data source used for this study was the AT developer's portal API. Scheduled GTFS and real-time data was utilised to generate a complete dataset. We retrieved the following data from the GTFS APIs:



### Bus Classification

- Supplied by AT, contains tare weight 

## Assumptions and Interpolations

**Important section**

- Outline the assumptions made when forming the model inputs from the data
- Outline the assumptions inherent the model already (e.g. emissions calculated at the trip level based on average speed)
- Outline the assumptions around passenger loading and the impacts of it on the model
- Present results of comparison to real fuel consumption data (if we receive the data)

## Outputs and Visualisations of the Analysis Tool

- Brief description of outputs of the model
