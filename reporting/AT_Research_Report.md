## Background and Purpose

- Outline the Stakeholders involved in this work (i.e. NZTA & AT)
- Outline the motivation and benefit for public bus emissions to be estimated using a software-driven approach
- Declare the intent to use the model already developed by generating the required inputs from provided data
- Outline the broad limitations of the approach (i.e. categories of assumptions)

**Draft**

There is currently a national drive to reduce emissions as a measure of mitigating human-induced climate change. Within the transport sector, public transport is an important method of reducing the emissions of the transport network as a whole. The majority of buses on New Zealand public transport networks are diesel. Therefore, improving national and regional understanding of the emissions of buses on the public transport network can assist with planning and decision-making at a high level to meet emission reduction goals.

The most accurate methodology to estimate emission quantities is to examine fuel consumption of the buses on a public transport network. However, this approach has several limitations. These include: 

- Buses on the network are typically used for other purposes (e.g. private charters, rail replacements, special services). The emissions generated by these activities are not attributable to public bus network.
- Fuel consumption data can be commercially sensitive under certain contractual frameworks.
- This data is not typically collected centrally by the public organisation operating the entire network.

As a result, a software-based approach using network operation data in conjunction with formulae from the European Union EMEP/EEA air pollutant emission inventory guidebook may be more suitable. This approach is likely to be easier to implement and roll out at a large scale while maintaining acceptable levels of accuracy. 

A successful trial was undertaken by GWRC and VUW in 2019 to use a software-based approach to calculate the present and historical emissions of the public transport bus fleet across the Wellington region. As a result of this trial, NZTA Waka Kotahi has requested a proof-of-concept study to examine whether this model can be applied to the Auckland region. This work was undertaken in collaboration with Victoria University of Wellington and supervised by Chris Vallyon.

This pilot study will examine the emissions generated by two bus operators on the Auckland network, Go Bus and Ritchies. Collectively, they service **Number**% of the trips across the Auckland bus network. Auckland Transport manages the public transport network across Auckland. They will provide the operational data that will be processed into the inputs for the emissions model. The emissions model then uses these inputs to generate an estimate of the emissions generated by each bus on a given trip. The output from the model can then be aggregated upwards to provide an estimate for the emissions generated by a given vehicle, a given route, or over the entire network.

This report will outline the methodology used to produce this model. In the instance where provided data may be incomplete or limited, we will outline any assumptions and interpolations required in order to generate a complete model. 



## Overview of Methodology

- Describe the retrieval of data from the developer's portal (i.e. the various APIs and the data that they provide)
- Describe how the data sources are joined to generate the inputs for the model
- Outline the process of the model produced in the previous study 

The methodology used to apply the model to the Auckland context can be separated into the following two broad steps:

1. Procurement, joining, and filtering of raw operational data into the form used by the Emissions model.
2. Using the previously developed Emissions model to estimate and visualise large scale emissions based on the processed operational data.

The aim of the first step is to collate and generate several data fields for each trip in the analysed dataset. For reference, a trip is a sequence of two or more stops undertaken by a specific vehicle on a specific time and date. Each field typically serves one of two primary purposes: to assist with filtering for further analysis/visualisation or as an input to the emissions model. A database schema with these fields and the required data types/formats for our model is included at the end of this report **Confirm this** .
The data inputs to the emissions model are as follows:

- EURO classification of the engine of the vehicle that carried out the trip.
- Average speed (in kmh) of the vehicle over the entire trip.
- The distance of the trip in km.
- Tare weight (in kg) of the vehicle that carried out the trip.
- Passenger loading represented by the total distance travelled by individual passengers on the trip in km.

The data fields that assist with filtering and visualisation are as follows:

- Date the trip occurred on.
- The departure time of the vehicle from the first stop on the route.
- The name of the route that the trip services.
- The vehicle ID number that identifies the vehicle that carried out the trip within the operator's fleet list.

The emissions model was developed during the Wellington trial and reused on the Auckland bus operational data. This model is based on formulae from the European Union EMEP/EEA air pollutant emission inventory guidebook and NZTA data on the NZ personal vehicle fleet **references?**. The model estimates the following quantities for each trip:

- Fuel consumed in kg **(or liters?)**.
- The carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2-equiv) generated in kg. This is the sum of CO2 and the CO2 equivalent of other greenhouse gases (methane & nitrous oxide) produced by the combustion of diesel.
- The quantities of each of the non-CO2 greenhouse gases (methane and nitrous oxide) produced in kg.
- The quantities of pollutant gases (carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides, hydrocarbons, and airborne particulate matter) produced in kg. These gases have a detrimental environmental and health impact in the environment they are emitted in.
- The CO2-equivalent generated if each passenger had instead travelled in an average personal car as the sole occupant. This is intended as an estimate of the carbon cost of not running a given trip.

The outputs from the model are visualised in a tool called "BEVis" that was developed as an extension of the Wellington trial. These visualisations are displayed later in the report.

The rest of this section will describe the software implementation of this methodology that we developed over the course of this study.

### Data Sources

The primary data source used for this study was the AT developer's portal API. Scheduled GTFS and real-time data was utilised to generate a complete dataset. We retrieved the following data from the GTFS APIs:



### Bus Classification

- Supplied by AT, contains tare weight 

## Assumptions and Interpolations
