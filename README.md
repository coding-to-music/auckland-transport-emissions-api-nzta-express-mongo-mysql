# ATE

## Research Emissions Model for Auckland Transport

This repo contains the code used to scrape data from the Auckland Transport API, and join this data with other data to create a single model of a sample of the bus operations on the Auckland Transport network between Dec 2020-Jan 2021.

## Setup

Nodejs is used as the runtime environment for the program so this must be installed.

Nodejs is available for download [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

Installation and Running:

<ol>
    <li>  In a console, navigate to `YourInstallationDirectory/ATE` </li>
    <li>  Enter `npm install package.json` 
          This will install all the necessary packages for our program </li>
    <li>  In the console, while still located in `/ATE` folder, type `node views/app.js` </li>
    <li>  Navigate to `localhost:3000` to interact with the server now running on your machine. </li>
</ol>

## Quick start guide

Our data pipeline is an implementation for us to show one way to completely generate the emissions of a given dataset. This serves as both the preprocessor and the processor (clean and join datasets to form Operational Dataset, and use Pax data with Fleet data to generate the emissions.)

Aquiring data, and calling endpoints until `/join_routes_to_final` serve as preprocessing. `/join_pax_km` and `/calculate_emissions` perform the emissions calculating step.

Be aware you may change the connection object via `const client = new MongoClient(config.mongodb.uri, { useUnifiedTopology: true });` OR changing var `config.mongodb.uri` to your connection object.

### Aquiring data

Be aware you may change the connection object via `const client = new MongoClient(config.mongodb.uri, { useUnifiedTopology: true });` OR changing var `config.mongodb.uri` to your connection object.

#### Realtime Data

The script `realtimeScript\RealtimeScript.js` must be run continuously to create the necessary data from the AT API. This can be deployed on a local machine and left running, however this is vulnerable to power failures. It was previously run inside a screen env on a server master node for ~2months with approx ~24hrs downtime.

The subscription key can be changed with the var at the top (serach for "let key").

#### Schedule Data

The script `models\scheduleConfiguration.js` can be run once everytime the schedule changes.

**_NOTE_** If the current datasets are between generation and the schedule changes (ie we once had trips scheduled for 24.01 but it change on 21.01) please run the `/repair_database` endpoint to fix the dataset before generating the next.

### Installing necessary data

Assuming you have run the script to pull the schedule automatically, and you have the data needed, data can be inserted using the mongoimport tool (Windows dist here: https://docs.mongodb.com/database-tools/installation/installation-windows/). Heres an example of the import urls for our datasets:

`mongoimport --db teste --jsonArray --collection calendar --drop --file "calendar.json" mongoimport --db teste --jsonArray --collection calendarDate --drop --file "calendarDate.json" mongoimport --db teste --collection realtime_raw --drop --file "realtime_raw.json" mongoimport --db teste --jsonArray --collection routes --drop --file "routes.json" mongoimport --db teste --jsonArray --collection trips --drop --file "trips.json" mongoimport --db teste --jsonArray --collection versions --drop --file "versions.json"`

**_NOTE_** There is no connection URL in these imports so mongoimport will import these to a local db. Please ensure that your db connection objects are consistent across files, and match the db you import these collections to.

The main endpoints to generate the necessary dataset are:

- `/generate_schedule`
- `/join_raw_routes_to_final`
- `/join_pax_km`
- `/calculate_emissions`

In order to use these end points, we need the schedule information in the format specified, and the raw information in the same placed into a MongoDB Database.

The connection object within `views\app.js` at the top must be changed to suit your connection to your database. It currently looks like `const client = new MongoClient(config.testing.uri, { useUnifiedTopology: true });`, prehaps with a different first arg (the connection uri). The db object (search for "let dbo") must also be changed to the correct collection for your data.

The pipeline has some dependancies on hardcoded dates, this is mainly due to time constraints. Please change the hard coded dates in the four endpoints above to suit your dataset, otherwise the pipeline will not work.

Finally, calling these 4 endpoints above in order will generate the completed dataset.
